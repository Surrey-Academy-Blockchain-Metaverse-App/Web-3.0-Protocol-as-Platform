## Abstract:

We present our vision for Web 3.0 as a Protocol-as-Platform (PaaP), integrating AI-driven agentic intelligence, modular blockchain infrastructure, and privacy-enhancing technologies. It addresses current Web 3.0 challenges such as fragmentation, scalability, security vulnerabilities, and overemphasis on financial speculation. The framework emphasizes interoperability through cross-chain bridges, composability via modular components, and intelligent automation using AI. Key aspects include AI-powered smart contracts, decentralized storage with IPFS/KV, and privacy-preserving computation via zero-knowledge proofs. The paper advocates for a shift from speculative economies to utility-based systems, proposing reputation-based rewards, gamified participation, and universal gas fee subsidization to drive mass adoption. Additionally, it highlights the importance of AI in enhancing governance, risk management, and user experience while ensuring privacy and security. By fostering global collaboration among developers, researchers, and policymakers, the authors aim to create a self-sustaining, decentralized AI economy that prioritizes long-term value over short-term gains.
